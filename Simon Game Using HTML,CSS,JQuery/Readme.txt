The Simon Game is a straightforward game in which the user must repeat the pattern shown by the programme.
 Each round adds a new step to the pattern-making process, increasing the difficulty of the game. 
 Furthermore, the programme should play a different sound for each field that is activated. 
 We used JavaScript for the project's backend and HTML and CSS for the frontend.
